<H1><b>A* Search and Uniform Cost Search</b></H1><br> A* Search and Uniform Cost Search are graph traversal and path search algorithms. Starting from a specific starting node of a graph, both algorithms aims to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). Both the algorithms are implemented in Python
